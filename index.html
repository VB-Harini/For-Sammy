<h1>Hey Sammy</h1>
<p>
This is not meant to be anything elaborate or over the top. I just randomly
decided to sit and put something together on my own, with a little help from
GPT bhaiyaa for the coding part obviously, and leave it here for you to read
whenever you feel like. I know this is probably one of the most random things
I have done so far, but honestly that is very on brand for me at this point.
There is nothing very serious you have to do here, just read normally and go
through it at your own pace. This is again just a long ass message.
</p>
<button class="btn" onclick="next('s2')">Continue</button>

<!-- SCREEN 2 -->
<div class="screen" id="s2">
<div class="card">
<p>
Okay… so where do I even properly start. Over time I have realised one thing
very clearly, not everything that actually matters has to look big or obvious
from outside. Sometimes the quieter things end up staying longer in memory.
Still, I will be honest about one thing. This whole past week did make me feel
a little weird internally. Watching people give you chocolates, accessories,
and all sorts of nice things made me think whether I was slowly falling behind
without even realising it properly from my side.
</p>
<button class="btn" onclick="next('s3')">Next</button>

<!-- SCREEN 3 -->
<div class="screen" id="s3">
<div class="card">
<p>
Every single time I came up with some idea to get you something, somehow it felt
like someone had already given you that exact type of thing. After one point I
was genuinely sitting and wondering what even makes sense anymore. On top of
that, I am honestly not very great when it comes to buying gifts in general.
I suck at it. I do tend to mess it up half the time. So instead
of forcing something just for the sake of it, I thought it is better to do
something different in my own unusual style.

If you actually observe properly, most of what I do usually follows the same
pattern only. Athey painting, some random artwork, sometimes one cringe letter
also gets added into the list. I am not someone who naturally jumps into very
dramatic big gestures. Half the time my methods probably look either boring or
slightly weird from outside perspective. But that is just how my brain normally
functions. I end up doing things in my own way even when I know it is not the
most impressive stuff to do at all.

At the same time, this was never really about competing with what anyone else
gave you. That part was never the main point for me. What has always mattered
more is the space we slowly built over time. All the random talks, the pointless
arguments, complete silence, and those small small in between moments
that most people outside would probably not even notice properly. Those things
somehow stay with me longer than the obvious visible stuff.

<button class="btn" onclick="next('s6')">Next</button>

<!-- SCREEN 6 (MUSIC STARTS HERE NOW) -->
<div class="screen" id="s6">
<div class="card">
<p>
I know I do not always say things very directly. Half the time I just behave
normally as if everything is understood without me expressing it out properly.
But the truth is I do notice more than I openly react to. Whether it is your
mood shifts, or the way you react to the smallest
things, most of it quietly registers somewhere in the background. I just do
not always make it obvious in the moment.

<!-- SCREEN 7 -->
<div class="screen" id="s7">
<div class="card">
<p>
Also just to say this very plainly, if situations were different and if I had
full freedom with money to spend the way I wanted, I probably would have picked
something much bigger for you without thinking twice. Since that was not really
possible right now, I worked within what I could manage without
overdoing anything unnecessarily. So this is what made the most sense to me at
this point of time. And so yeah I did it.

<!-- SCREEN 8 -->
<div class="screen" id="s8">
<div class="card">
<p>
Anyway yeah… that is pretty much what I wanted to say for now. I did not want to
keep repeating the same thing again and again and end up boring you in the
process. So I will just leave it here without stretching it more than required.
If you reached till this point without skipping, that itself is already more
patience than most people usually give hahaha.
